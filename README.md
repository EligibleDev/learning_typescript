# Lesson 1

So the tsc command will take my typescript file and create a new js file containing the translated to javascript version of the typescript code i've written in the ts file.
sounds kinda complicated but i suppose its due to my poor language skills.

The tsconfig is a vast config file. We can control many things with it. Like where our ts files are located and where the compiled js files should be etc.

Since we've configured where our ts files are located, from now on we don't have to provide the file name after the tsc command. We now just have to type the tsc command.
